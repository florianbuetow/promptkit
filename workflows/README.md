- **[ai-assisted-coding.md](ai-assisted-coding.md)** - Best practices for coding with AI
- **[code-review-workflows.md](code-review-workflows.md)** - AI-enhanced code review processes

## 🧪 Test-Driven Development

Don't be the person who just says "fix this" in a loop. Instead: Write the test first, get the AI to iterate on the implementation of the function until the test passes.

Or even better: Turn on YOLO mode, ask to write the test, write the function and iterate fixing the function.

### Key Benefits

- **Faster iteration** - AI can quickly implement and fix
- **Better code quality** - Tests ensure functionality
- **Clear requirements** - Tests serve as specifications
- **Reduced debugging** - Catch issues early

## 🤖 AI-Assisted Coding

Learn how to effectively collaborate with AI coding assistants to maximize productivity while maintaining code quality.

### Core Principles

- **Be specific and provide context**
- **Include examples when possible**
- **Break down complex tasks into smaller steps**
- **Use the AI's strengths** (pattern recognition, code generation)
- **Iterate and refine your approach**

## 🔍 Code Review Workflows

Integrate AI assistance into your code review process for more thorough and efficient reviews.

## 💡 Best Practices

- **Start with clear requirements** - Define what you want before asking AI
- **Use incremental development** - Build and test in small steps
- **Leverage AI for repetitive tasks** - Let AI handle boilerplate and patterns
- **Maintain human oversight** - Review and understand AI-generated code
- **Document your workflows** - Share successful patterns with your team
