## 🚀 Key Concepts

### 🧪 Test-Driven Development

Don't be the person who just says "fix this" in a loop. Instead: Write the test first, get the AI to iterate on the implementation of the function until the test passes.

### 🧠 Memory Bank

Leverage memory banks to maintain context across sessions and improve AI understanding of your project.

### 🎨 Prompt Engineering

Learn how to craft effective prompts that get you the results you want on the first try.

## 💡 Best Practices

- Be specific and provide context
- Include examples when possible
- Break down complex tasks into smaller steps
- Use the AI's strengths (pattern recognition, code generation)
- Iterate and refine your prompting techniques
