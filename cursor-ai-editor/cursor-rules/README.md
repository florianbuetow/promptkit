- **`dev_workflow.mdc`** - Development workflow and process guidelines
- **`cursor_rules.mdc`** - General cursor usage rules
- **`self_improve.mdc`** - Self-improvement and learning guidelines

## 🛠️ How to Use

1. **Choose a Rule Set:** Browse the `examples/` directory for rules that match your tech stack
2. **Copy to Project:** Place the `.mdc` file in your project's `.cursor/rules/` directory
3. **Customize:** Modify the rules to match your specific project needs
4. **Use in Cursor:** Reference with `@rules` in your Cursor chat
